# aspnetapp-infrastructure  
*Terraform-based AWS Blue/Green deployment for ASP.NET Core on ECS Fargate*

## ðŸš€ Overview  
This project automates provisioning of infrastructure and CI/CD pipelines on AWS using Terraform, enabling zeroâ€‘downtime **blue/green deployments** of an ASP.NET Core application running in ECS Fargate, leveraging ALB, ECR, CodeDeploy, CloudWatch alarms, and GitHub Actions.

## ðŸ§© Architecture  
- **VPC setup** with 2 public subnets, internet gateway, security group  
- **ECR repository** for storing container images with lifecycle policy  
- **ECS cluster & service** running in Fargate  
- **Application Load Balancer (ALB)** with blue/green target groups and listeners on ports 80 and 8080  
- **CodeDeploy application & Deployment Group** configured for blue/green deployments and rollback  
- **CloudWatch alarms** for unhealthy targets and CodeDeploy deployment success/failure  
- **GitHub Actions workflows** for Terraform validation (`terraform.yaml`), linting (`terraform-lint.yaml`) and deployment (`build-deploy.yaml`)
